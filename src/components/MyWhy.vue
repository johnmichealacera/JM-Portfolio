    <p class="pt-8 text-justify leading-loose">I always challenged myself to be a better version of myself every step of the way. I always see programming as a very steep mountain to climb. It is difficult but also very rewarding. I always feel satisfied once I complete projects and learn different things along the way. I see programming as a part of my life and not as something that I call as a job.</p>
