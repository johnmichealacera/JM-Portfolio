      <p class="text-justify leading-loose py-5">I am a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology way back 2015. After graduating, i worked on two jobs unrelated to my course. First is working at the Accounting Department in the government and then recently was as a Customer Service Representative.

    I decided to quit my job as a CSR last April 2020 to pursue my passion and profession as a Web Developer. I then started relearning stuffs and is very motivated to work hard on improving my skills as well as to be able to land a job as a programmer.
  
  I worked as freelancer for some time and finally got my first IT corporate job on January 2021.
Right now, I am working for 2 years as a Full Stack Developer with some knowledge of DevOps.</p>
